# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to identify suspicious activity with high accuracy, minimizing both false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions missed by the model).
